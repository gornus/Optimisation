This is the README for the Subsystem 2: Insulation for wall 1 and wall 2


This Subsystem aims to optimise the insulation required for walls.


Code for wall 1:
- run the wall1_code.m
- it outputs all the results shown in tables and graphs on the report
- a multiobjective scatter plot will be displayed, and you must input the number of the point you select in the command window. This point will be the closest one to the line of y = -x as explained in the report.
- the code will then output the final results including the cost.

Code for wall 2:
- run the wall2_code.m
- it outputs all the results shown in tables and graphs on the report
- a multiobjective scatter plot will be displayed, and you must input the number of the point you select. This point will be the closest one to the line of y = -x as explained in the report.
- the code will then output the final results including the cost.

Dependencies:
- the scripts require MATLAB_R2018b with the Optimisation Toolbox installed
- the scripts will read data from mat_1_database and mat_2_database_final
