This is the README for Subsystem 1: Boiler Optimisation

This Subsystem aims to optimise the overall boiler design.


Code description:
- run boiler_optimisations.m
- it outputs all the results shown in graphs in the report.
- The material properties were loaded in manually. If you wish to experiment with other materials, you must change this.
- the code will then output the final results, including the cost and the comparison to the benchmark, in the command window.


Dependencies:
- the scripts require MATLAB_R2018b with the Optimisation Toolbox installed
